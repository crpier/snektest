# TODO

- Look at all instances of an `elif` and see if a `match` would be better
- Evaluate whether documenting raised exceptions in docstrings is worth it
- Remove superfluous comments again
- Looks like `breakpoint()` is not shown when passing `-s`. Fix it
- Might move `snektest.testing`
- Maybe have a look over complexity-related rules I ignore in noqa comments
- replace old style assertions with `assert_*` functions in internal tests
