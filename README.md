# snektest
## Features

- Lazy params?

## TODOs

- Capture warnings and show them at the end
- Double check levels of the logs: some are definitely wrong
- Might improve naming of many functions
- Cool idea: if multiple tests are outputted in a short span of time (like 1 second), print them together so you can match their tail ends (like the OK/FAIL part)
